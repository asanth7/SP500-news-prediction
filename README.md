# SP500-news-prediction

This repository contains a variety of Google Colab files that each demonstrate the data collection and preprocessing steps in addition to usage in different model architectures. These include pre-trained BERT models and custom LSTM models for both binary and multiclass S&P500 index price prediction based on global news headlines. Finally, a PDF of the resulting research paper that lays a strong foundation of economic and financial concepts in addition to detailed descriptions of the different model architectures and their performance, is included.
